<h1>Here's the story behind our सफर </h1>

<p>
    I left behind the opportunities and comforts of the USA to return to home and build somethingdeeply rooted in India's heritage. A brand that truly represents our artisans and their craftsmanship. But instead of support, I've faced endless roadblocks, forced to rebrand because of bureaucratic restrictions. The very system meant to empower artisans is limiting young entrepeneurs like me from bringing KHADI to the world in a new light 
    
    But a name doesn't define a vision. This is not the end, but a new begining. They can take the name, but they can't take the mission
    
    WE'RE COMING BACK STRONGER, LOUDER AND UNSTOPPABLE
</p>

<p>
    "The Name You Knew. The Journey You'll Love"
    Our name was a symbol of tradition. But our journey is expanding, growing, evolving.
    A change here! but not just any change
